# Internship Tasks

During my internship, I worked on several tasks aimed at enhancing my skills in Python programming and cybersecurity. Below is an overview of the tasks I completed:

## Task 1: Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher task involved implementing a simple encryption and decryption algorithm based on the Caesar cipher technique. The goal was to create a Python script that could encode and decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Task 2: Password Complexity Checker

The Password Complexity Checker task focused on creating a Python script to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The script aimed to provide feedback on the password's complexity to help users create more secure passwords.

## Task 3: Simple Keylogger

The Simple Keylogger task involved developing a Python keylogger program capable of logging keystrokes on a computer system. The keylogger captured and recorded the keys pressed by the user, storing the data in a file for analysis or monitoring purposes.

## Task 4: Network Packet Analyzer

The Network Packet Analyzer task required building a Python program to analyze network packets and extract information such as IP addresses, protocols, payload data, and sources. The program utilized libraries like Scapy to capture and analyze network traffic, providing insights into the network communication.

Each task provided valuable hands-on experience and helped me strengthen my programming skills and understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
